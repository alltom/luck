        LucK
  with any luck,
    an alternative ChucK interpreter


  REQUIREMENTS
    + ocaml, ocamllex, ocamlyacc
         you probably installed these together
    + omake
         I recommend getting this through GODI
         but I think you can download it separately
    + luck
         not this project, but like, actual luck


  BUILD
    $ cd src
    $ omake

  DO SOMETHING
    $ ./luck
    reads a LucK script from stdin
       and does nothing
       or yells at you if it's not valid
       so much anger!
