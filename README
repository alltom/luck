        LucK
  with any luck,
    an alternative ChucK interpreter


  REQUIREMENTS
    + ocaml, ocamllex, ocamlyacc
         you probably installed these together
    + omake
         I recommend getting this through GODI
         but I think you can download it separately
    + luck
         not this project, but like, actual luck


  BUILD
    $ cd src
    $ omake

  TEST
    $ omake test
    $ ./parser_test

  DO SOMETHING
    $ ./luck
    reads a LucK script from stdin
       then tries to execute it
       or yells at you if it's not valid
          of if it didn't know how to compile all of it yet
          (probably this one)

       [[things that work]]
           4 => int a;
           <<< "outer a =", a >>>;
           while(int a < 10) <<< "inner a =", (a + 1 => a) >>>;
           <<< "outer a is still", a >>>;
           for(0 => int i; i < 5; i++) <<< "I have", i, "apples" >>>;
           repeat(9) <<< "I can do it nine times!" >>>;
